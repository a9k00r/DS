This is a C program for bottom up Dynamic programing to evaluate profit for o/1 Knapsack in order of O(NW) 
where, N = Total no of objects 
       W = Total capacity of Knapsack
       
       Time complexity: O(NW) using DP BUP approach (2 For loop N*W)
      Space Complexity: O(NW) (Extra space taken by array of size N*W)
